Stock-List-Program
==================
This Stock market program was made for easier analysis of stocks.  
The problem with most Stock Sites is that they only show one stock  
at a time which is frustrating when you are short on time and need  
to check all your stocks at once. Other Sites have a limit on the  
number of stocks you can see at once.

What I've Done
==============
I have made my own Stock Listing Program where I go get the stocks  
prices I want and draw them on the page.   

When you hover over the stock, you will see the full analysis of the  
stock.

You can also add as many Stocks as you want.

Versions
========
I have made two version of the stock program.  
1. The stock analysis is on the right side of page whenever you  
hover over it.  (stockListRight.html)
2. The stock analysis will appear close to your cursor whenever you  
hover over it.  (stockList.html)

Side Notes
===========
1.For some reason in IE you have to open the developer tools on the page  
to show the stocks. I think IE process the page too fast and developer tools  
slows it down.  
2. By clicking on the white space, the iframe will disappear.
